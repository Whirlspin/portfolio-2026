# Short summary

My first real NextJS project. Jan 2026.

Hand-coded with minimal AI input.

Referenced entirely from a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/yfLTWupiLU8oHQJbHrj7qo/Portfolio-2026?node-id=0-1&t=eS0wdDR3U1RjRlt2-1) I made. [**Design system tokens**](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1052575036916494414) for Tailwind CSS were a massive help to get my design-dev alignment.
